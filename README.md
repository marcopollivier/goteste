# Avenue Code - Product Manager

## API

> You can access the Application API on the address: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/Product](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/Product)

## Run Tests and Application

- Build application with Maven: ```mvn clean install```

- Run application on Spring Boot: ```mvn spring-boot:run```

- Run tests: ```mvn -fn test```

## Database

This application uses the Memory DB *H2* and the [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) is the responsible to create the database structure and to menage it.

## TODO - Not Working well until now

For any reason, the JPA Fetch configuration is not working correctly. 
I need to check why this occurring. 
I wasted a lot of time trying fix it. 
For this, any queries does not working correctly.

## Data model

![alt text](readme/img/image002.png "Model")

## Scenario

We have a Product Entity with One to Many relationship with Image entity

Product also has a Many to One relationship with itself (Many Products to one Parent Product) 

1ยบ Build a Restful service using JAX-RS to perform CRUD operations on a Product resource using Image as a sub-resource of Product.

2ยบ Your API classes should perform these operations:

1) Create, update and delete products
2) Create, update and delete images
3) Get all products excluding relationships (child products, images) 
4) Get all products including specified relationships (child product and/or images) 
5) Same as 3 using specific product identity 
6) Same as 4 using specific product identity 
7) Get set of child products for specific product 
8) Get set of images for specific product


3ยบ Build JPA/Hibernate classes using annotations to persist these objects in the database 

Technical Specification:

1) Maven must be used to build, run tests and start the application.
2) The tests must be started with the mvn test command.
3) The application must start with a Maven command: mvn exec:java, mvn jetty:run, mvn spring-boot:run, etc.
4) The application must have a stateless API and use a database to store data.
5) An embedded in-memory database should be used: either H2, HSQL, SQLite or Derby.
6) The database and tables creation should be done by Maven or by the application.
7) You must provide BitBucket username. A free BitBucket account can be created at http://bitbucket.org. Once finished, you must give the user ac-recruitment read permission on your repository so that you can be evaluated. 
8) You must provide a README.txt (plain text) or a README.md (Markdown) file at the root of your repository, explaining:
- How to compile and run the application with an example for each call.
- How to run the suite of automated tests.
- Mention anything that was asked but not delivered and why, and any additional comments.
